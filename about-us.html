            <p class="intro">Made a decision to buy furniture online? At Furnify, we’ve always worked around the goal of making buying furniture easy. Now, we’re working on making it easier.</p>
            
            <p class="main-content">Furniture has steadfastly been the hidden hero of the house and therefore, to buy furniture is to truly invest. We don’t fully realize the difference between an ‘unfurnished’ home and a ‘furnished’ one until we step into one and figure out how important it is to buy furniture the right way. Memories might be remembered and poems might be written around the different rooms, views, and corners of a home, but it’s the furniture that brings out the life within it.</p>
        
            <p class="main-content">At Furnify, we have always believed that the decision to buy furniture was not just for a home, but for a life lived to the fullest. From our mad deadlines to our bad binge-watching, the life we live, lead, and practice revolves around furniture and therefore the decision to buy furniture. There’s a reason why we miss our own comfy furniture even in the most comfortable of hotels, and there’s a reason why there’s something special about working at our own workstation instead of someone else’s.</p>
            
            <p class="main-content">But it’s not just about our attachment to our own furniture; it's also about the hassles we face (or don’t face) when it comes to the decision to buy furniture, whether rental furniture or furniture for purchase, and about the budget plans we make (or don’t make) about our choice to buy furniture. From a baby’s first crib to our grandparents’ bedroom, furniture revolves around and with us, and our lives invisibly revolve around our decision to buy furniture.</p>
            
            <p class="historical-context">Before it was possible to buy furniture online, the decision to buy furniture in India was always a ‘once for life’ business. People used to buy furniture either after their first jobs or with their first families, and after the decision to buy furniture, it was passed down generation to generation until the furniture became unusable, after which the next round to buy furniture would be taken up by the next generation.</p>
            
            <p class="historical-context">Even after the advent of online buying furniture, the attempt to buy furniture online never really entered the Indian economic market. To buy furniture, as an online concept, has been a tricky affair in India. Furniture in India has always been meant for the concept of buying as a one-time purchase, and furniture has therefore traditionally been considered costly. Added to that, furniture, even if bought online, has always been thought of as a permanent fixture, making online furniture a ‘once and done’ affair at home due to the hassles of replacing it.</p>
            
            <p class="origin-story">The concept of buying online furniture itself is as recent as the early 2010s, when Furnify founder Ajith Karimpana first offered the convenience to rent and buy furniture online in India. When Ajith moved to Bengaluru from the USA, he realized that dealing with furniture—how to buy it, move it, sell it, replace it, re-buy it—became his biggest hassle.</p>
            
            <p class="origin-story">To add to that, the convenience to buy furniture by choosing from a wide spectrum of designs at affordable prices was hardly available. Furnify was born in 2011 with the idea that everyone deserved access to rent or buy furniture online without hassles or budget headaches. Furnify’s aim has always been to enable customers to live a fuller life with the freedom of renting or buying furniture online.</p>
            
            <p class="why-furlenco"><h5 class="footerh">WHY FURNIFY</h5></p>
            
            <p class="why-furlenco">Furnify’s vision has always been to make the process of buying or renting essential furniture an easy decision, especially for people who move to cities for their careers or those who don’t want to stick with one set of furniture for life. Furnify offers the freedom to buy original furniture, created by in-house designers, providing an excellent mix of comfort and design.</p>
            
            <p class="why-furlenco">When you buy furniture online from Furnify, you get access to furniture designs that offer a cosmopolitan vibe, with functionality and flexibility at their core. Buying furniture online from Furnify means added flexibility, affordable prices, and the option to rent and replace according to your needs.</p>
            
            <p class="future-of-furlenco"><h5 class="footerh">WHAT’S NEXT FOR FURNIFY</h5></p>
            
            <p class="future-of-furlenco">It’s a new decade and a new world. The pandemic has shown us that the division between home and office has significantly narrowed. Work-from-home has become the norm, and mental and physical wellness have become crucial. Therefore, the decision to buy furniture online is more important than ever. People have realized that having peace at home is more important than chasing deadlines. This realization is linked to how they furnish their homes.</p>
            
            <p class="future-of-furlenco">Furnify is working towards a new version of home and rental furniture, making it easier and more flexible to buy furniture online. With a furniture network extending to more than 15 cities in India, Furnify now offers the freedom to buy furniture online without compromises. </p>
            
            <p class="freedom-to-choose"><h5 class="footerh">FREEDOM TO CHOOSE</h5></p>
            
            <p class="freedom-to-choose">In a world where daily living offers freedom of choice, why should buying furniture online be any different? Furnify's new vision removes all the inconveniences tied to buying furniture online in India. Whether from a local shop, showroom, or online, purchasing furniture often comes with setbacks. Furnify’s goal is to remove those barriers and deliver furniture directly to your home.</p>
            
            <p class="freedom-to-choose">Welcome to the freedom to choose how you want your furniture: short-term rent, long-term rent with a subscription plan, direct purchase, or refurbished furniture. The possibilities are endless, and the options are many. If you want to buy furniture you're currently renting, nothing’s stopping you! The Rent-to-own option lets you adjust your online furniture purchase decisions whenever you like.</p>
            
            <p class="freedom-to-change"><h5 class="footerh">FREEDOM TO CHANGE</h5></p>
            
            <p class="freedom-to-change">When we talk about buying furniture, the primary point of concern is usually the convenience of buying furniture online. After all, buying furniture is an investment. However, sometimes it feels like an experiment where we want to change how our homes look. Keeping that in mind, Furnify offers the ‘Freedom to Change’ option for those who buy furniture online, giving them the flexibility to make changes. </p>
        
            <p class="freedom-to-change">Furnify’s new plan makes online furniture rental, purchase, and replacement easier by enabling customers to swap their furniture sets for something new every few years, making renting or buying furniture online more convenient than ever before.</p>
